                       ObjectiveDrobpoox contains all necessary classes for working with Dropbox using Objectve-C on iOS.
                       Cocoapods installation supports iOS 8.0 and above. If you need iOS 7 support, copy all ObjectiveDrobpox files to your project and add WebKit as optional framework.
